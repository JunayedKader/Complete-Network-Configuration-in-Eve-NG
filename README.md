# Complete-Network-Configuration-in-Eve-NG
Unlock the full potential of my network infrastructure with this comprehensive Eve NG project. Experience a seamless blend of VLANs, DTP, VTP, Etherchannel, OSPF, NAT, VPN, and STP configurations, meticulously crafted for optimal performance and security.

Key Features:

  VLANs: Strategically segment my network to enhance performance and security.
  
  DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol): Dynamically negotiate trunking between switches for efficient resource utilization.
  
  VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol): Simplify VLAN management across switches, ensuring consistency and ease of administration.
  
  Etherchannel: Boost network performance and resilience through link redundancy and bandwidth aggregation.
  
  OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): Configure routers for efficient and scalable communication, adapting to dynamic network landscapes.
  
  NAT (Network Address Translation): Fortify my network's security by enabling private networks secure access to the public internet.
  
  VPN (Virtual Private Network): Establish secure connections, ensuring data privacy and integrity over public networks.
  
  STP (Spanning Tree Protocol): Eliminate network loops, enhancing stability in complex topologies.
